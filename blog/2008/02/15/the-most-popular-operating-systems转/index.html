<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/">AIX</a>  (<i>Advanced Interactive eXecutive</i>) - a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/proprietary.html">proprietary</a> (i.e., commercial) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/flavors.html"><i>flavor</i></a> (i.e., variant) of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix_upper.html">UNIX</a> launched by IBM in 1990 for use on its mainframe <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computer.html">computers</a>.
</p></p>

<p><p>
<a href="http://www.amiga.com/">Amiga</a> - launched with the<br />
pioneering Amiga personal computer in 1985 and continues to be<br />
developed today for the PowerPC processor. Amiga features an elegant <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gui.html">GUI</a> (graphical user interface) together with some of the flexibility of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/unix-like.html">Unix-like</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html">operating systems</a>.
</p></p>

<p><a href="http://slackcode.cn/mt-static/html/editor-content.html?cs=utf-8" name="011318"> </a>
<p>BeOS - developed by Be Incorporated in 1990 as a <i>media operating system</i>
that was optimized for digital media (e.g., digital audio, digital<br />
video and three-dimensional graphics). BeOS has some Unix-like<br />
characteristics, including its use of the <i>bash</i> (the default on <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html#447381">Linux</a>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command.html">command</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/shell.html">shell</a>
and its directory structure, but it was written in entirely new code.<br />
The loyal user base was very disappointed when the company failed<br />
commercially, and thus several open source projects, including <a href="http://www.beunited.org/">beunited.org</a>, are under way that are aimed at recreating and updating (e.g., new video drivers) BeOS.
</p></p>

<p><a href="http://slackcode.cn/mt-static/html/editor-content.html?cs=utf-8" name="715008"> </a>
<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a> - an open source derivative of 4.4BSD<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font> (Berkeley Software Distribution Version 4.4) that serves as the core for the <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html#781532">Macintosh OS X</a>. It was originally released in March 1999. There is also a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gnu.html">GNU</a> version of Darwin, which is called <a href="http://www.gnu-darwin.org/">GNU-Darwin</a>.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> - the most popular of<br />
the BSD operating systems, accounting for approximately 80 percent of<br />
BSD installations (at least until Darwin came onto the scene). FreeBSD<br />
was begun in early 1993 based on 4.3BSD, and the first version, 1.0,<br />
was released in December of that year.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.freedos.org/">FreeDOS</a> - begun in 1994 by Jim Hall with the goal of becoming a complete, free and fully <a href="http://www.linfo.org/operating_systems_list.html#112398">MS-DOS</a> compatible operating system for x86 (i.e., Intel-compatible) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/cpu.html">CPUs</a> (i.e., central processing units).
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">GNU/Hurd</a> -<br />
has been under development by Richard Stallman and his Free Software<br />
Foundation (FSF) since 1990. The core component, the Hurd (<i>Hird of Unix-replacing daemons</i>) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel.html"><i>kernel</i></a>
(i.e., the core of the operating system), is still not completed<br />
because of its very ambitious goal: to surpass Unix-like kernels in<br />
functionality, security and stability while remaining largely<br />
compatible with them.
</p></p>

<p><!--more-->
<a href="http://h20338.www2.hp.com/hpux11i/cache/324545-0-0-0-121.html">HP-UX</a>
- a proprietary flavor of UNIX developed by Hewlett-Packard for its HP<br />
9000 series of business servers. HP-UX 1.0 was released in 1986.</p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.sgi.com/products/software/irix/">IRIX</a> - a<br />
proprietary flavor of UNIX introduced by Silicon Graphics, Incorporated<br />
(SGI) in 1982 for applications that use three dimensional visualization<br />
and virtual reality.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/1996-05/sunflash.960529.11819.xml">JavaOS</a> -  developed by Sun Microsystems in 1996 for use in <i>embedded systems</i> (i.e., combinations of circuitry and <a href="http://www.linfo.org/software.html">software</a> built into other products). JavaOS is written primarily in the Java programming language and includes a Java <i>virtual machine</i> (which allows running of any Java program regardless of the type of CPU used) as a fundamental component.
</p></p>

<p><a href="" name="447381"> </a>
<p><a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/linuxdef.html">Linux</a> - a high performance, yet completely free, Unix-like operating system launched by <a href="http://www.linfo.org/linus.html">Linus Torvalds</a> in 1991. <i>GNU/Linux</i>,<br />
as it is also called (because it makes extensive use of utilities and<br />
other software developed by the GNU project) is suitable for use on a<br />
wide range of <a href="http://www.linfo.org/platform.html">platforms</a> and is compatible with both 32 <a href="http://www.linfo.org/bit.html">bit</a> and 64 bit processors. More than 200 <a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/distributionslist.html"><i>distributions</i></a>
(i.e., versions) of Linux have been introduced, among the most popular<br />
of which are Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, Debian and Ubuntu. Although its<br />
overall market share is still small, Linux is the most rapidly growing<br />
of any major operating system.
</p></p>

<p><a href="" name="781532"> </a>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> - was released<br />
by Apple Computer, Inc. in 2001 as a replacement for its aging Mac OS<br />
operating system. Now commonly referred to as <i>Mac Classic</i>, the<br />
pioneering Mac OS was introduced with the first Macintosh computers in<br />
1984, and it was the first commercial operating system to include a<br />
GUI. Mac OS X was developed as an entirely new, BSD-based operating<br />
system that runs on a more advanced processor (the PowerPC) but which<br />
maintains backward compatibility with the Mac OS (which runs on the<br />
Motorola m68k). The Mac OS X consists of Darwin and the <i>Mach microkernel</i> (an advanced kernel developed at Carnegie-Mellon University) together with Apple&#8217;s proprietary <i>Aqua</i>
GUI (which is widely regarded as the best in the industry). Apple is<br />
currently completing a transition of its hardware and OS X from the<br />
PowerPC to x86 processors.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Windows</a> - the<br />
successors to the very popular MS-DOS, it was announced in 1983, and<br />
the first version, Windows 1.0, was finally released in 1985. Microsoft<br />
Windows encompasses two groups of operating systems (i.e., Windows<br />
95/98/ME/CE and Windows NT/2000/XP) which resemble each other<br />
superficially and share compatibility with many of the same application<br />
programs but which have very different internal structures.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/minix.html">MINIX</a> - a small, open source UNIX <a href="http://www.linfo.org/clone.html">clone</a> that was first released in January 1987. It was written for use in <a href="http://www.linfo.org/computerscience.html">computer science</a>
education by Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum of Vrije Universiteit in<br />
Amsterdam, and it is now best known for its role in inspiring Linus<br />
Torvalds to develop Linux.
</p></p>

<p><a href="" name="112398"> </a>
<p><a href="http://www.bellevuelinux.org/ms-dos.html">MS-DOS</a> - a single-user, single-tasking operating system that uses a <a href="http://www.linfo.org/command_line.html"><i>command line</i></a> (i.e., text only) <a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_interface.html">user interface</a>.<br />
It was launched by Microsoft in 1981 and used on the first personal<br />
computers, which were introduced by IBM in the same year. In spite of<br />
its very small size and relative simplicity, MS-DOS is one of the most<br />
successful operating systems that has been developed to date.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> - a derivative of 4.3BSD and launched in 1993, as was the case with FreeBSD. It is possibly the most <i>portable</i> of all operating systems, with the ability to run on more than 50 processors, ranging from the acorn26 to the x86.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> - spun off from NetBSD<br />
in 1996 by Theo de Raadt in Calgary, Alberta because of a desire to<br />
place even more emphasis on security. OpenBSD has a goal of becoming<br />
the most secure operating system, and it claims to have had only one<br />
remote hole in the default install in more than eight years.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.palmsource.com/">Palm OS</a> - developed by<br />
PalmSource, Inc. for personal digital assistants (PDAs). Palm OS<br />
features flexibility and ease of use. It is the leading PDA operating<br />
system, used in more than 36 million mobile devices, and there are more<br />
than 20,000 software titles for it, far more than for any other<br />
handheld platform.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.qnx.com/">QNX</a> - a Unix-like, POSIX-compliant<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font>, <a href="http://www.linfo.org/real_time.html">real time</a>
operating system developed in 1982 that is widely used for mission- and<br />
life-critical embedded applications. QNX can also be used as a desktop<br />
operating system and features a unique and attractive GUI. Although it<br />
is a commercial operating system owned by QNX Software Systems in<br />
Ontario, Canada, it is free for personal use.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.skyos.org/">SkyOS</a> - a commercial hobbyist<br />
operating system developed by Robert Szeleney from 1996. SkyOS has some<br />
features that resemble BeOS. It is mostly POSIX compliant, and comes<br />
with many of the GNU utilities, including the very highly rated <a href="http://www.linfo.org/gcc.html">GCC</a> (GNU Compiler Collection).
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.solariscentral.org/">Solaris</a> - developed by<br />
Sun Microsystems for its SPARC processor and the most widely used<br />
proprietary flavor of UNIX. Solaris was introduced as SunOS in 1989,<br />
and it was based on BSD Unix. A version for x86 processors is also<br />
available.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://www.tron.org/index-e.html">TRON</a> (The Real-time<br />
Operating system Nucleus) - started by Professor Ken Sakamura of the<br />
University of Tokyo in 1984 with the goal of creating <i>an ideal computer architecture</i>.<br />
TRON claims to be the world&#8217;s most widely used operating system because<br />
it is embedded in a vast number and variety of electronic products. The<br />
TRON specifications are open, but there is no requirement to make <a href="http://www.linfo.org/sourcecode.html"><i>source code</i></a> (i.e., the human-readable form in which the software is originally written) freely available, in contrast to the GPL<font size="-1"><sup>3</sup></font>.
</p></p>

<p><p><a href="http://h30097.www3.hp.com/">Tru64</a> - a proprietary<br />
flavor of UNIX offered by Hewlett-Packard for the 64-bit Alpha<br />
processor. It is unusual among Unix-like operating systems in that it<br />
is built on the Mach kernel, which is also used in Mac OS X. Tru64 was<br />
originally developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and called<br />
Digital UNIX. </p></p>

<p><font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)<br />
is a version of UNIX that was developed at the University of California<br />
at Berkeley (UCB) in the 1970s. It is the ancestor of the modern BSDs<br />
(i.e., FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Darwin) and its technology was also<br />
incorporated into the other Unix-like operating systems as well as into<br />
other operating systems, including Microsoft Windows. The final version<br />
was 4.4BSD.
</p></p>

<p><p>
<font size="-1"><sup>2</sup></font>POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface for uniX) is a set of programming <a href="http://www.linfo.org/interface.html">interface</a> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/standards.html">standards</a>
governing how to write source code so that the applications are<br />
portable between operating systems. POSIX support was at one time<br />
adopted by the U.S. government as a standard requirement for its<br />
purchases. Linux and other Unix-like operating systems are POSIX<br />
compliant.

<p><p>
<font size="-1"><sup>3</sup></font>The GPL (GNU General Public License), the most popular of the many <a href="http://www.linfo.org/free_software.html">free software</a>
