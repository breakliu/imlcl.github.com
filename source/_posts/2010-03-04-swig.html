<p><a href="http://www.swig.org/index.php" target="_blank">SWIG</a>是个好东西，架构很灵活，以后用这个来写PHP扩展模块是不错的选择。</p>

<p>SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and  C++ with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl.  It  works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using  them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to  access the underlying C/C++ code.  In addition, SWIG provides a  variety of customization features that let you tailor the wrapping  process to suit your application.</p>
