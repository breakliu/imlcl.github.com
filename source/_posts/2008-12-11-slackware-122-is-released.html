<p><a href="http://slackware.com/"> Slackware 12.2发布啦</a></p>

<p>Yes folks, 'tis the season to announce a new release of Slackware.  With a shiny new kernel, many package updates, and the newly added ability to install from a Samba share, we bring to you the latest in the stable Slackware 12.x series.  Slackware 12.2 ships with the 2.6.27.7 Linux kernel, the Xorg 1.4.2 X server (with many driver, library, and application updates), Xfce 4.4.3, KDE 3.5.10, simplified wired and wireless networking with wicd in /extra, package upgrade management with slackpkg moved into the main tree, support for non-usb-storage digital cameras through libgphoto2, pm-utils (tools to support suspend and hibernate through HAL), and much, much more.  This release brings the system up-to-date without compromising stability or compatibility with the 12.x series.</p>

<p>More details may be found in the <a href="http://slackware.com/announce/12.2.php"><strong>official announcement</strong></a>.</p>

<p>If you like Slackware, please consider supporting the project by picking up a copy of Slackware 12.2 from the <a href="http://store.slackware.com/"><strong>Slackware Store</strong></a>.  The discs are off to replication now and pre-orders are being accepted for the official 6 CD or 1 DVD set.  Also by popular demand, we now have black T-shirts with the original Slackware logo for sale.  Check 'em out!</p>

<p>Thanks are due to the Slackware crew, the developers of <a href="http://slackbuilds.org/"><strong>slackbuilds.org</strong></a>, the fine folks on <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/"><strong>linuxquestions.org</strong></a>, IRC, and everyone else who pitched in to help make this another great Slackware release.  We couldn't have done it without your help.</p>

<p>As always -- have fun!</p>

<p>Pat and the Slackware crew</p>
