<p><a href="http://slackcode.cn/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/logo.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-146" title="slackware logo" src="http://slackcode.cn/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/logo.png" alt="" width="238" height="63" />
</a>slackware官网换成这个标志了，感觉很cool，但好像与其KISS原则有点背离:P<br />
有兴趣可以到<a href="http://www.slackware.org/">slackware.org</a>看看哦。</p>

<p>另KDE也更新到slackware的current/testing里了，官方消息：<br />
That's right -- KDE version 4.1 is now part of Slackware -current (in the /testing directory), so for everyone who can't wait to try it out, have a look at it! We're all (very happily) using it here now, and it has come a long way since the first 4.x release. Congratulations to the KDE team for the fine work (and many thanks to Robby Workman and Heinz Wiesinger for all the help with build scripts and testing for the initial Slackware packaging of KDE4). Have fun! :-)</p>

<p>Also, we recently commissioned Mark from <a href="http://www.senile-felines.com/"><strong>Senile Felines Designs</strong></a> to create a unique new Slackware Logo (that's it there in the upper right), as we were getting a number of bug reports that the old logo could not be read easily while standing on one's head.  ;-)  We think he did a great job with it!  If you like the new logo, we are selling shirts, stickers and other products with it at the <a href="http://cafepress.com/volkerdi"><strong>Official Slackware CafePress Store</strong></a>, and if the design proves to be popular we'll likely have some of these products mass produced for the main <a href="http://store.slackware.com/"><strong>Slackware Store</strong></a>. Meanwhile, you can help support the Slackware project, _and_ be the first on your block to show off the new Slackware "flippy" logo! :-)</p>

<p>国内的朋友推荐来自广州机房的slackware源: <a href="http://slackware.wanguangming.com/mirror/">http://slackware.wanguangming.com/mirror/</a>，速度飞快</p>

<p>另LinuxToy介绍的OpenBox窗口管理器不错，快速简洁，推荐喜欢的朋友试试</p>

<p>该死的楼梯，希望洵洵没大碍</p>
